## From Monitoring to Logging

Can you answer the following two questions about the performance of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ with your group?

  * Which of your API endpoints is the slowest? How slow is it?
  * Where is the time being spent in this endpoint?

How do you find out this info?

Please provide your answers in the [Endpoint Performance Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HpGn7KnHeq2-Ivebk8ghQ942gi7wh2-0iXJouPzIvNY/edit)

Note: As Helge mentioned in class, the project is not about competing who has a faster implementation. However, in the real world you usually want to know performance information because it's very likely that you will look for optimization candidates among your slowest endpoints.
