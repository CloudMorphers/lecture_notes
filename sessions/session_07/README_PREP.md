#### A) Mapping Subsystems

  - Map the all subsystems (components) of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ in a UML component diagram.
  - That is, map all those parts that are either deployable separately or that contain bigger logical groups of functionality.


  - If rusty on component diagrams, you may want to check one of the following websites:
   * https://developer.ibm.com/articles/the-component-diagram/
   * http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/componentDiagram.htm.
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram


#### B) Read a Paper

Read the first 7 pages of Kitchenham et al. [_"Software quality: the elusive target"_](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d7a45bdd09e59dde273da90448232ddbc7287f70) until section "MODELING QUALITY".

If you feel like you can of course read the entire paper.
