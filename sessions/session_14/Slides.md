# Evaluation

---

### Evaluation

As announced in class, the course is almost over, so it is time for evaluating it.

We run an evaluation that should be really easy and should consume only a few minutes of your time.
The purpose of the evaluation is to provide feedback so that Mircea and I can improve the course next year.

We would like to ask you to provide up to three negative and up to three positive comments about the course. You can do that here: http://138.68.66.124:8888

Please note, the kind of evaluation we are running mimics a public paper-based process.
That is, all information that you enter as feedback will be read by Mircea and me, i.e., it is public information.
Please provide your feedback latest by Tuesday (May 14th) 12:00.

Thank you in advance.

### ITU-wide Evaluation

Please participate in the ITU-wide evaluation on LearnIT.
Three years ago, the response rate for this course on LearnIT was 0%, which is unpractical since ITUs management mainly looks at these evaluation results:

  * BSc: https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=225465
  * MSc: I believe it is the same link as above, isn't it?

# Exam Preparation

---

### Exam Preparation

  * You can find a bit deeper description of the exam and how it is conducted [here](https://github.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/blob/master/exam_details.md).
  * See exam description on LearnIT ([BSc](https://learnit.itu.dk/local/coursebase/view.php?ciid=1618)/[MSc](https://learnit.itu.dk/local/coursebase/view.php?ciid=1620)) under section _Ordinary exam_
  * The course and exam are based on your project. However, the entire curriculum is relevant for the exam.


--

  * Please let us know in good time before the exam if you have any special conditions that lead to that you have longer exam times so that we can schedule accordingly.

---

#### "I want to have the exam on day ..."

  * We cannot promise that the exams can be scheduled so that everybody is 100% happy with its placement.
  * But you can help us scheduling by indicating your preferred days and days you would like to avoid in the [shared spreadsheet](https://ituniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/2025DevOpsSoftwareEvolutionandSoftwareMaintenance/Shared%20Documents/General/exam_preferences.xlsx?d=wa73cafcd21464ab6840b0784d4baf0ae&csf=1&web=1&e=anuNZb).
  * Once we have feedback from all of you, I will share an exam plan in our Git repository.

Important, when editing the spreadsheet, please make sure that the number of group members is still correct. If not please update it and inform us about it (by sending a message in the Teams channel to us).

--

#### What I would like to supervise

  * Projects on software quality, software quality assessments
  * Tools implementing software quality metrics
  * Mining (VCS, issue trackers, etc.) studies
  * Projects on the following three examples


  * Group projects (3 to 4 students)
  * Importantly, you are **motivated**
  * I will be on paternity in fall... The best is to contact me **in person** in case you are interested.
