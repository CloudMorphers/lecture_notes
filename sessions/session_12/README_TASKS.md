# Infrastructure as Code

The final part of your project (ðŸ¥³) is automating also the creation of infrastructure. 
You can choose how you want to do it:
- Using Terraform
- Using Vagrant (can do most of the things that are required)
- Using bash scripts that use the 
	- REST API of the VM provider
	- command line tool of the provider (e.g. [doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/) for DigitalOcean)

It does not matter which do you use. It matters much more that you are able to do it and to argue for the pros and cons of your approach.
