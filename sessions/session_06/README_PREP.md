## Investigation of your systems


Can you figure out the following properties of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ with your group fellows?

    * CPU load during the last hour/the last day.
    * Average response time of your application's front page.
    * Amount of users registered in your system.
    * Average amount of followers a user has.

Keep a log of what you are doing to figure out these values.

Categorize each of the above properties by potentially interested parties in an organization. For example, _business department_ (hypothetical), _operator_, etc.

Which of the above categories do you consider the most important? In which role are you then?
